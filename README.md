# Queue Managment System
This Python project implements a queue management system using custom queue classes (ChildQueue) with various operations like adding data, popping data, deleting specific queues, and managing multiple queues. The project is structured around an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

  **-Queue Creation:** Create new queues with specified names and sizes.
  **-Data Management:** Add data to queues, pop data from queues, and view queue contents.
  **-Queue Deletion:** Delete specific queues or all existing queues.
  **-Interactive Interface:** User-friendly CLI for performing queue operations.

  3. Install the required dependencies (Python 3.x is required):
      *pip install -r requirements.txt*
     
## Usage
  Run the main script Main.py to start the queue management system:
